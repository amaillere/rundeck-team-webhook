## Before create issue.

Issues which was created have problem. It almost can't reproduce by me.

- Your server environment.
- Software and plugin versions, java environment.
- Other enabled plugins on rundeck.
- Log: rundeck/service.log

There is a good way of resolve issue. It's you put reproducible environment with issue, such as Vagrantfile, Dockerfile, or chef recipes.
